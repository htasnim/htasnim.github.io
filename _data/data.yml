    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of New Mexico (UNM), 
      expected to graduate in the fall of 2023. I earned an MS in Computer Science from 
      UNM in 2021. I received my Master’s and Bachelor’s Degrees in Computer Science 
      and Engineering from the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh.

      
      I am working as a Research Assistant under the supervision of [Professor Melanie Moses](https://www.cs.unm.edu/directory/faculty-profiles/melanie-moses.html) 
      at [Moses Biological Computational lab](https://moseslab.cs.unm.edu/). My research primarily focuses on using computational tools to 
      understand complex biological systems, with a particular emphasis on applying information 
      theory-based frameworks to large-scale image datasets. My work has the potential to make 
      significant contributions to the understanding of a variety of biological phenomena, 
      including the immune response to infections like SARS-CoV-2.

      My research interests include: 1) Computational Biology 2) Information Theory Frameworks
      3) Modeling Complex Systems 4) Data Science 5) Image Analysis 6) Scientific and Inforamation 
      Visualization 7) Machine Learning for Images
